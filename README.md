# E-commerce Admin Flutter Application

This repository contains the source code for a Flutter application designed for administrative tasks within an e-commerce platform. It serves as a foundational project to manage various aspects of an online store.

## Project Overview

The "ecommerce\_admin" project is a new Flutter application likely intended to provide an administrative interface for an e-commerce system. This could involve functionalities such as managing products, orders, customers, categories, sales data, and other back-office operations. The project provides the basic structure for building such a robust administrative tool.

## Technologies Used

  * **Flutter**: Google's UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop from a single codebase.
  * **Dart**: The primary programming language used for developing Flutter applications.

## Project Structure

The project follows a typical Flutter application structure, including:

  * `android/`: Contains Android-specific configurations and code.
  * `ios/`: Contains iOS-specific configurations and code.
  * `lib/`: The main directory for the application's Dart source code.
  * `test/`: For unit and widget tests.

Additionally, standard Flutter configuration files like `pubspec.yaml` (for managing dependencies and project metadata) and `analysis_options.yaml` (for static code analysis rules) are included.

## Getting Started

To set up and run this project, you will need to have a Flutter development environment configured on your machine.

### Prerequisites

  * [Flutter SDK](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
  * [Dart SDK](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://dart.dev/get-started) (typically included with the Flutter SDK)
  * An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Visual Studio Code or Android Studio, with the Flutter and Dart plugins installed.
